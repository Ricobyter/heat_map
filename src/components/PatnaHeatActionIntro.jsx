        Recommendations for Patna District Heat Action Plan

      <p className="text-[15px] sm:text-base mb-3 text-slate-700">
        In recent years, Patna district has witnessed rising intensity, frequency, and duration of heatwaves, driven by rapid urbanisation, climate change, and the loss of green cover. These extreme heat events disproportionately affect vulnerable groups such as informal sector workers, children, the elderly, and low-income households who face heightened risks due to inadequate housing, limited access to cooling infrastructure, and greater exposure to extreme temperatures. Within the framework of the Patna Model Heat Action Plan, the following recommendations have been developed and categorised under Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. Each recommendation is contextualised for Patna’s urban, peri-urban, and rural mix, tagged by expected implementation timeline and feasibility. The recommendations prioritise vulnerable populations and critical public facilities, while ensuring solutions are:

          Locally grounded, leveraging readily available materials and resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Infrastructure-linked, building on and strengthening existing systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Institutionally embedded, integrating heatwave resilience within the core functions of municipal governance, public health systems, and disaster management operations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[15px] sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        This structured approach aims to ensure that Patna’s Model Heat Action Plan moves beyond reactive measures to a systemic, evidence-based model of heatwave preparedness, response, and recovery.
